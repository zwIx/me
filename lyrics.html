    <pre>
        I'm packin' my bags that I didn't unpack the last time
        I'm sayin', "See you again, " so many times, it's becoming my tagline
        But you know the truth, I'd rather hold you
        Than try to catch this flight
        So many things I'd rather say
        But for now, it's goodbye
        </pre>
        <br>
        <pre>
        You say I'm always leavin'
        You, when you're sleepin' alone
        But the, the car's outside
        But I don't wanna go tonight
            </pre>
            <br>


        <pre>
        I'm starin' at the same four walls in a different hotel
        It's an unfamiliar feelin' but I know it so well
        Oh, but you know the truth, I'd rather hold you
        Than this mobile in my hand
        But I guess it'll do, 'cause for you
        I would run up my phone bill
            </pre>
            <br>
            <pre>
        You say I'm always leavin'
        You, when you need me the most
        But the, the car's outside
        But I don't wanna go tonight
                
            </pre>
